# DevShop



### Why
# DevShop?



### Why
# DevShop?

Keeps track of all the things:

<small>Users, servers, environments, tasks, tests, & services.</small>

Does all the things:

<small>Deploy code, deploy data, run tests, backups, commit config, logs, solr...</small>

Integrates with all the things:

<small>Drush & Drupal APIs.  Connect to Acquia, Pantheon, or any other Cloud Server Providers.</small>



### Why
# DevShop?

It is a platform to build upon.

It is a place for humans and machines to do work.



### Why not
# DevShop?

DevShop is not perfect.

DevShop is not simple.

DevShop might not do exactly what you want it to do.

but...



### Why
# DevShop?

Least painful.

Most accessible.

Most comprehensive.

Most opportunity.



# Consensus?

<img src='img/notsureif.jpg'>



# Consensus?

<div class='fragment'>
  DevShop may not be the best platform for the job...
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
If something else out there is, we'd love to see it and work to improve it.
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
Either way, we need to collaborate, and we need consensus on a common devops platform.
