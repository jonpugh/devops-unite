Drupal itself goes through this cycle.

# Why?

<p class='fragment'>Was PHP the best programming language?
<p class='fragment'>Was Drupal the best CMS?

 <h1 class="fragment">NO.</h1>



# Why?

<p class="fragment">
  They give us great power, with the least amount of pain.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
  They are focused on the needs of the implementers.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
  They are incredibly useful and easily accessible.

Introduction

DevOps is everything that is needed to support a stable application and maintain productive software development.

Developers + Ops <em class='fragment'>(+ Everyone Else)</em>

### Exploration

# Open Process

People teach each other techniques, tools, and process.



### Collaboration

# Open Products

People build products to simplify everything.



### Consensus?

<div class='fragment'>

<h1>Community</h1>

</div>



## Community is more important than Code.

HTML <img src="img/arrow.png"> PHP <img src="img/arrow.png"> Drupal

Community is what made these platforms what they are.



I formerly invite you to join our community.



# DevShop



### Why
# DevShop?



### Why
# DevShop?

Keeps track of all the things:

<small>Users, servers, environments, tasks, tests, & services.</small>

Does all the things:

<small>Deploy code, deploy data, run tests, backups, commit config, logs, solr...</small>

Integrates with all the things:

<small>Drush & Drupal APIs.  Connect to Acquia, Pantheon, or any other Cloud Server Providers.</small>



### Why not
# DevShop?

DevShop is not perfect.

DevShop is not simple.

But DevShop is comprehensive, useful, and open source.



# Consensus?

<div class='fragment'>
DevShop may not be the best platform for the job...
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
If something else out there is, we'd love to see it and work to improve it.
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
Either way, we need to collaborate, and we need consensus on a common devops platform.
