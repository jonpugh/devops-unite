Out of the 111 open sourced CMS...
<div class='fragment'>62 are PHP.</div>

Drupal itself goes through this cycle.

So why did we choose these?

<p class='fragment'>Was PHP the best programming language?
<p class='fragment'>Was Drupal the best CMS?

 <h1 class="fragment">NO.</h1>



HTML <img src="img/arrow.png"> PHP <img src="img/arrow.png"> Drupal
<p class="fragment">
  They give us great power, with the least amount of pain.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
  They are focused on the needs of the implementers.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
  They are incredibly useful and easily accessible.

## So where are we now?

# Drupal DevOps

Introduction



# DevOps?
DevOps is everything that is needed to support a stable application and maintain productive software development.

Developers + Ops <em class='fragment'>(+ Everyone Else)</em>

### Exploration

# Open Process

People teach each other techniques, tools, and process.



### Collaboration

# Open Products

People build a product that systemitizes the best techniques, tools, and processes.



The time has come for collaboration.

Without consensus, we will not get our next platform.



# DevShop

It's a platform, not a tool.



### Why
# DevShop?

Keeps track of all the things:
<small>Users, servers, environments, tasks, tests, & services.</small>

Does all the things:
<small>Deploy code, deploy data, run tests, backups, commit config, logs, solr...</small>

Integrates with any other tool.
<small>Including Acquia, Patheon, or any remote drupal host.</small>

DevShop is a platform for building the future of web development.



# Consensus

We need consensus on a common DevOps platform,

just like we needed consensus on Drupal and PHP before that.



# Consensus

Consensus does not mean the platform is the best, or the fastest, or the simplest.

Consensus means that the platform is empowering, and has proven to solve real problems.

Consensus brings us all together to work toward improving our situation with a common goal.


# Consensus?

DevShop may not be the best platform for the job.

If something else out there is, we'd love to see it and throw it in the running.
